## Get Started
`git clone https://github.com/umdio/umdio.git` (or download as a zip, we don't mind!)

If you want to install all the dependencies on your machine, you'll need at least ruby2.2 and mongo + node if you want to work on the docs, and nginx if you want do it the way we do it on the server. bootstrap.sh is an outline of the installs you'll need, or you can ust run it if you are on ubuntu 14.04.

Or, [install vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/), and
`vagrant up` from the folder you cloned.

This might take a while the first time (~30min), because it installs things and runs scrapers to fill the database. After the first time, it will be quicker. Plus, your config is now the same as everyone else's, and the same as the server. Fancy that.

While you are waiting, read over the project docs.

You can get a shell on the virtual machine with `vagrant ssh`, then `cd umdio` and `bundle exec rake up` to run the server. You can see the api running at `localhost:3000` on your host machine.

Try a few things. Ponder the return of `localhost:3000/v0/courses/sections`.

## Workflow
Edit on your machine in your favorite text editor, and changes will automagically show in your machine's browser, so long as you leave the virtual machine shell open.

Write tests that fail, write code that makes the tests pass. Run tests with `bundle exec rake` on the VM. If you are running scrapers or managing the database, remember that mongo is running on the VM, so run your scrapers there too.

If you want to see how the server will run with nginx, check `localhost:4080`. From the VM shell, `nginx -s reload` to update. Cool to check this once in a while, like before a commit. (Tough to view the api from your machine's browser, unless you update your hosts file with a line like `api.localhost 127.0.0.1`. This shouldn't really matter, but if you want, it's there.)

## Documentation
We are only as good as our docs.

We're using Jekyll to make managing documentation easier. Edit files in docs/src, then run `jekyll serve` from the docs folder. See your work at `localhost:4000`.

The files in src/<endpoint>/_posts are written in markdown - you specify some metadata, and then write text as you would. Learn more about [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to use all its power.

The files in each endpoint's folder each get rendered on the page as sections. The order of the sections is determined by the date in the name of the file - hence the strange names of the files.
