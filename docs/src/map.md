This endpoint lets you get location data about University of maryland. Right now, it's just the locations of buses, but there's tons more data available, and we will gradually add it and document it. If you want to use the data now, now, now, check out [http://maps.umd.edu/arcgis/rest/services](http://maps.umd.edu/arcgis/rest/services) - that's the source of all the umd map data. It's a little confusing - that's why we want to wrap it!

All map data is copyright University of Maryland 2015.
