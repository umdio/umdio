The current version is version 0.

When we release a new version of the API that isn't backwards-compatible, we'll update the version number. The old version will remain accessible, but we'll deprecate and no longer support them after a reasonable amount of time. Even though ‘/v0/courses’ might be very different than ‘/v1/courses’, your app that uses v0 will still work. 

Every request needs to specify the version number in the url. If you leave out the ‘/v0’ or ‘/v1’, or you’ll get an error.

<!-- EXAMPLE -->

The current version is live at:

```
https://api.umd.io/v0
```
