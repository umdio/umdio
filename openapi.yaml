    Welcome to umd.io, the open-source API for University of Maryland data. If
    you are building a University data-focused app, hack, or project, you’re in
    the right place. This site will walk you through basic API use and document
    all supported API calls.


    umd.io is a GETful API. It follows RESTful conventions, but for now, you can
    only get data – you can’t create, update, or destroy.


    We're now in version 1! We might add new endpoints or more data to existing responses,
    but we won't remove anything without a major version change.


    We are actively looking for contributors! Tweet, email, or otherwise get in
    touch with us.
